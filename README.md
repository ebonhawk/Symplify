# Symplify
This is (hopefully) a simple introduction to using Git as I develop my first android app with Android Studio.
I've attempted to use VCS before but made a complete mess of it, so hopefully this time I can do it right. Feel free 
to follow along with me and provide any feedback! 

Symplify is to be a simple-to-use ToDo app ideally designed for those that need structure in their life, but easily get
overwhelmed when using other productivity apps. There will be many out there like this one, but this one is mine, and I 
will love it!
